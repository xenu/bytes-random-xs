=head1 NAME

Bytes::Random::XS - Perl extension to generate random bytes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bytes::Random::XS qw/random_bytes/;

    my $bytes = random_bytes( $number_of_bytes );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the C<random_bytes> function which allows you to
generate specified number of random bytes. It uses exactly the same
algorithm as L<Bytes::Random>, but it's implemented in XS, so it's
much faster (see L</BENCHMARKS> section).

=head1 BENCHMARKS

Comparison of L<Bytes::Random> and Bytes::Random::XS perfomance:

    # random_bytes(64)

                      Rate    B::R@0.02 B::R::X@0.01
    B::R@0.02      45903/s           --         -97%
    B::R::X@0.01 1462857/s        3087%           --

=head1 EXPORT

Nothing is exported by default. C<random_bytes> is an optional export.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

This module is B<not> intended to be cryptographically secure. If that
concerns you, consider using L<Bytes::Random::Secure> instead.

=item *

L<Bytes::Random::XS> is an XS module, which means it's not compatible
with L<App::FatPacker>. L<Bytes::Random> is a pure Perl alternative
that doesn't have this problem.
